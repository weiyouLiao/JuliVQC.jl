**JuliVQC.jl** is a high-performance Julia library designed for **variational quantum circuit (VQC)** simulations. Its mission is to provide **seamless support for automatic differentiation** while enabling users to easily build **hybrid quantum-classical algorithms**.

The core philosophy of **JuliVQC.jl** revolves around three principles:

1. **Transparent implementation**: Built using Julia, a high-performance and dynamic programming language.
2. **Efficiency-focused**: Cache-friendly elementary operations with shared-memory parallelization.
3. **Native automatic differentiation**: Supports both noiseless and noisy quantum circuits.
